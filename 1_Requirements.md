# Discription

## 
A universal motor is a special type of motor. This motor works on both AC and DC supply.
In this project, the universal motor performance for AC and DC sources are compared.
Lossand efficiency of the universal motor are calculated for both AC and DC sources. Speed of
the universal motor is controlled using the tapped field winding method. The Differential
equations of universal motor are solved by Euler's method and analysed using c
programming. The matlab Simulink is used for getting torque speed characteristic of the
universal motor and to exhibit the speed control of the motor using tapped field winding
method.
