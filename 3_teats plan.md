# Numerical Method

## Methodology
1)Backward Euler’s Method:
The Backward Euler’s method is an implicit one which,contrary to the explicit method in thesolution by solving a differential equation involving the current state of the system and later one.

2)Electrical and Mechanical Equations of Universal Motor.

3)Universal Motor Parameters for AC Input adn DC Input and Theoretical Calculations.
