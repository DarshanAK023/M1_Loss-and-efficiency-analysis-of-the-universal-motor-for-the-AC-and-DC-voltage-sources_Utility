# Discription
## 
A universal motor is a special type of motor. This motor works on both AC and DC supply.
In this project, the universal motor performance for AC and DC sources are compared.
Lossand efficiency of the universal motor are calculated for both AC and DC sources. Speed of
the universal motor is controlled using the tapped field winding method. The Differential
equations of universal motor are solved by Euler's method and analysed using c
programming. The matlab Simulink is used for getting torque speed characteristic of the
universal motor and to exhibit the speed control of the motor using tapped field winding
method.

 # *What 
 
  ###
   A universal motor is a special type of motor. This motor works on both AC and DC supply.
   In this project, the universal motor performance for AC and DC sources are compared. Loss
   and efficiency of the universal motor are calculated for both AC and DC sources.
 # *Why
   ### 
   A universal motor is similar to DC series motor which works in both AC and DC supply is
   due to the torque insensitive towards the direction of the current. The universal motor has
   few advantages that are low costs, high-speed rotation, and high starting torque. A universal
   motor is used in mixers, sewing machines, washers. Due to the high-speed application, over
   induction motor universal motor is preferred.
 # *When
   ### 
   The Construction of a universal motor is very similar to the construction of the dc series
motor. It consists of a stator on which field poles are mounted. Field coils are wound on the
field poles. However; the whole magnetic path (stator field circuit and also armature) is
laminated. Lamination is necessary to minimize the eddy currents which induce while
operating on AC.

 # *Where
   Universal motor is used primarily in areas where the noise level is not critical but high revolutions
   are important.
   some applications are Drills and screwdrivers
• Mixers and Blenders
• Fans and hairdryers
• Vacuum cleaners
 # *Who 
   The ability to operate at extremely high speed connecting to a single-phase AC network made
   them very popular in domestic appliances. Also, it has miniature sizes and can be used in
   compact household devices. In industrial branches, this equipment is also often used, but its
   effectiveness is not suitable for everyone.
 # *How
   ###
   Speed of the universal motor is controlled using the tapped field winding method. The Differential
   equations of universal motor are solved by Euler's method and analysed using c
   programming. The matlab Simulink is used for getting torque speed characteristic of the
   universal motor and to exhibit the speed control of the motor using tapped field winding
   method.
# SWOT Analysis..

  # Strengths
   ##  
   1) A universal motor is made of the field winding i.e. stator and armature i.e. rotor. Universal motors are series coiled with a high initial torque and speed characteristic        variables.
   2) The Construction of a universal motor is very similar to the construction of the dc series
     motor. It consists of a stator on which field poles are mounted. Field coils are wound on the
     field poles
     
  # Weakness
  
   design complexity is more compared to the induction motor, comparing to DC motor wear of commutator is greater and less efficient
   
  # Opportunities
  
Designers use various methods to control the speed and to avoid the universal motor running
at a dangerous speed. One method is to build the universal motor into a device so that the
motor would never run at no load. These types of motors are used for small applications that
favor connecting the motor directly to the system that it drives.

  # Threts
  
the universal motor are as follows, design complexity is more compared to the induction motor, comparing to DC
motor wear of commutator is greater and less efficient. A universal motor is made of the field winding i.e. stator and armature i.e. rotor. Universal motors are series coiled with ahigh initial torque and speed characteristic variables.
