A universal motor is similar to DC series motor which works in both AC and DC supply is due to the torque insensitive towards the direction of the current.
The universal motor has few advantages that are low costs, high-speed rotation, and high starting torque. A universal motor is used in mixers, sewing machines, washers. 
Due to the high-speed application, over induction motor universal motor is preferred.
The disadvantages of the universal motor are as follows, design complexity is more compared to the induction motor, comparing to DC motor wear of commutator is greater and less efficient.
A universal motor is made of the field winding i.e. stator and armature i.e. rotor. Universal motors are series coiled with a high initial torque and speed characteristic variables
